# Learning World Models By Denoising the Enviroment 

Humans naturally filter out irrelevant noise and focus on important information to understand and predict how systems behave over time. For example, when watching a busy scene, we instinctively ignore distractions like background chatter. However, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle in similar scenarios. They have difficulty separating meaningful signals from noisy, high-dimensional data, particularly in environments with complex and dynamic noise, such as natural video streams. This limitation hampers their ability to make accurate, noise-free predictions and perform effectively in real-world situations.
