# Learning World Models By Denoising:  

Reproducing Results from the Paper: "Denoised Predictive Imagination: An information-theoretic approach for learning world models". This is done for my RL class, I'll update the changes soon!

Humans naturally filter out irrelevant noise and focus on important information to understand and predict how systems behave over time. For example, when watching a busy scene, we instinctively ignore distractions like background chatter. But, reinforcement learning algorithms struggle in similar scenarios. They have difficulty separating meaningful signals from noisy, high-dimensional data, particularly in environments with complex and dynamic noise. And this limitation hampers their ability to make accurate, noise-free predictions.
